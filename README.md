This is my first project written in Python and designed to run on Rasberry pi 2 & 3.
The python program will allow user to input ascii characters and then convert the input into morse code by emiting light with the LED.

Instructions:
You need to connect a 3.3V LED positive leg to RPi GPIO 4 and the negative leg to one of the RPi GND pin.
