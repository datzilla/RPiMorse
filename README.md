This is my first project created in Python.
I've started this project to learn Python and a bit of electronics.
This small python program has been tested and runs on Raspberry Pi 2.
You will need to connect a 3.3V LED pos leg to RPi GPIO 4 and the neg leg to one of the RPi GND pin.
The program allows user to enter an english sentence, translates that sentence to Morse Codes and light up the LED as morse code signal.
